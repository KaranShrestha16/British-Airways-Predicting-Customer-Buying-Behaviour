# British-Airways-Predicting-Customer-Buying-Behaviour
## Description
This project aims to predict customer bookings for British Airways by analyzing customer data. The objective is to develop a predictive model that enables the airline to engage potential customers proactively, using data-driven insights. The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Installation
To set up the environment and run this project, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by executing the following command:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


```

# Usage
1. **Data Exploration**: Start by exploring the dataset using the provided Jupyter Notebook. This will help you understand the structure and key statistics of the data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve the predictive power of the model. This may include transforming existing features or creating new ones from the raw data.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model, such as a Random Forest, to predict whether a customer will make a booking.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using cross-validation and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to interpret the importance of each feature in the model, helping to understand which factors most influence the predictions.


## Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes customer booking data. It contains various features that describe customer demographics, booking details, and other relevant information. The dataset is used to train the model to predict the likelihood of a booking.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Algorithm: The Random Forest algorithm is employed due to its ability to provide insights into feature importance.
- Training Process: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
- Evaluation Metrics: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate model performance. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure robustness.
## Results
The project concludes with a detailed analysis of the model's performance, highlighting the most significant features influencing customer booking behavior. The results are summarized with visual aids like feature importance plots and accuracy scores.
